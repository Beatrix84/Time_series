# Project 1
https://github.com/JTreguer/ia-bdx-ts-project2

* Visualization time series
* Clean the data if necessary
* Transform the series into a stationary series by removing its mean, its trend, its seasonal elements
* Verify the stationarity
* Study the auto-correlation by tracing the ACF and the PACF finally to fix the orders p and q of an ARIMA model
* Splitting data
* Fit the model
* Evaluate the model

# Project 2
https://github.com/JTreguer/ia-bdx-ts-project3

## Part 1
* Produce a sinus series
* Train and evaluate a simple RNN
* Train and evaluate a LSTM 
* Train and evaluate a GRU 
## Part 2
* Redo everything with the series chosen in project 1
    * RNN
    * LSTM
    * GRU
* Apply a CNN 1-D
* Apply a regression model
